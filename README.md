# Password Generator

A simple Python program that generates a random secure password using **uppercase letters**, **lowercase letters**, **numbers**, and **symbols**.
User can choose how many of each type he/she wants. and the generator shuffles them for extra security.

## How it works
1. The program asks:
   - How many letters you want
   - How many numbers you want
   - How many symbols you want
2. It randomly selects characters from each category.
3. It shuffles all of them to create a strong, unpredictable password.
